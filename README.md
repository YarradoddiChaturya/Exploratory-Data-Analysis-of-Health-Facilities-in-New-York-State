# Why did I choose this data?

My previous experience working with healthcare data has increased my curiosity about the healthcare sector. Though it's not my primary field, I'm particularly interested in studying data connected to healthcare because I'm keen to learn about and comprehend the inner workings of healthcare systems. I selected the Health Facility General Information dataset because I'm a newcomer to the nation and wanted to learn more about the medical facilities and services offered in New York State. This dataset provides a thorough overview of different healthcare institutions, such as clinics, hospitals, and other health services. By looking through this data, I hope to provide insightful discoveries to other students who, like myself, would benefit from knowing more about healthcare resources and options. This dataset gives me a thorough overview of all the different healthcare facilities in New York State, which will be a great place to start with my analysis.

By looking through this data, I intend to learn more about the many kinds of facilities that are out there, where they are located, and any trends that might be important to both medical professionals and anyone looking for information about healthcare services.

# Proposed Questions for Analysis:

Geographic Distribution: In what regions of New York State are medical facilities concentrated? Do any locations that are underserved and have poor access to healthcare?

Facility Ownership: Which types of facility ownership are the most prevalent ones? How does ownership differ geographically?

Facility Types and Services: How are hospitals, assisted living facilities, and hospices distributed across the several counties? In how many places are specialized services offered?

Time Analysis: What patterns are there in the dates of the facilities' openings? Are more recent facilities grouped in specific areas?

to kind, location, and ownership.

Anomaly Detection: Finding missing numbers or anomalies in facility records, such as inaccurate geolocations, incomplete addresses, or unusual opening dates
